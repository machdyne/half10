# Half10 Rack Mount Components

## Overview

Half10 is a work-in-progress 3D-printable modular system for 10" racks.

![Half10](https://github.com/machdyne/half10/blob/6bc6d6185a2d941c73202b8f6a48f6d6e79ae9fe/half10.png)

This repo contains 3D-printable models for 10" racks. The models can be printed with a bed size of 180mm (such as the Prusa Mini).

It currently contains a 4x compute-bay for the [Klinge](https://github.com/machdyne/klinge) FPGA computer, allowing up to 8 computers in a 10" 1U rack space.
